<h1>About Recollect</h1>

<p>
    <b>Recollect</b> - a reminder service for citizens - has a single goal:

    <b>To help make citizens lives just a little bit easier by providing them customized reminders for services they use to the device of their choice, at the time of their choice.</b>
</p>

<p>
Let's face it, we are all busy being parents, holding down jobs or enjoying the limited free time we have to try to remember things like when to take out the garbage or remembering little league schedules. Our job is to make your life easier by freeing the neurons you'd waste trying to remember these small details. If you aren't trying to remember to take out the garbage, hopefully it means you can spend a little more time thinking about your family, your work or whatever your passion may be. Ultimately, we believe that city services should be built around your life and we are trying to take a small step to bring that a little closer to reality.

<h2>History</h2>

<p>Recollect started as <a href="http://vantrash.ca">VanTrash</a>, an idea that <a href="http://eaves.ca">David Eaves</a> <a href="http://eaves.ca/2009/06/29/how-open-data-even-makes-garbage-collection-sexier-easier-and-cheaper/">blogged about</a> while thinking about open government data. Later at a <a href="http://vancouver.hackspace.ca/doku.php?id=super_happy_hacker_house">community hackathon</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/lukec">Luke Closs</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/kevinj">Kevin Jones</a> decided it might be a fun project. After enjoying some initial success we felt that everyone should enjoy the benefits of a garbage reminder service so we created <a href="http://recollect.net">Recollect</a>.</p> 

<h2>The Team</h2>

<h3>Luke Closs</h3>

Luke has been building software for over 10 years, from cellular networks to anti-spam to collaboration tools.  During that time Luke has found the most enjoyment as a toolsmith - building tools for his peers.  When Vancouver passed the Open Data initiative, Luke looked for ways to contribute his skills to help citizens get value out of the open data. The result was <a href="http://vantrash.ca">VanTrash</a>.  Luke is also a Lead Developer at <a href="http://socialtext.com">Socialtext</a> where he builds Enterprise Social Software, and is an author of many Open Source <a href="http://github.com/lukec">libraries</a>.
